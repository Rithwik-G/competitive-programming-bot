**Solution**
Let $$$m$$$ be the maximum among the numbers $$$a_i, a_{i + 1},\ldots, a_j$$$. Notice that there always exists such $$$k$$$ that $$$i \le k < j$$$ and $$$a_k = m$$$ or $$$a_{k + 1} = m$$$. Therefore, we can assume that Bob always chooses the pair of numbers $$$p$$$ and $$$p + 1$$$ ($$$1 \le p < n$$$) as $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$.
Therefore you need to consider the maximums in pairs of adjacent elements and take the minimum among them. Let $$$min$$$ be the found minimum, then it is obvious that the answer is equal to $$$min - 1$$$.
