**Solution**
To satisfy $$$D(k \cdot n) = k \cdot D(n)$$$, each digit $$$d$$$ in $$$n$$$ must become $$$k \cdot d$$$ after multiplying $$$n$$$ by $$$k$$$. In other words, none of $$$n$$$'s digits can carry over to the next digit upon multiplication. From this, we can deduce that each digit in $$$n$$$ must be less than or equal to $$$\lfloor \frac{9}{k} \rfloor$$$. Only thing left is to count all such numbers in the range of $$$10^l$$$ inclusive and $$$10^r$$$ exclusive.
Every number below $$${10}^r$$$ has $$$r$$$ or less digits. For numbers with less than $$$r$$$ digits, let's pad the beginning with zeroes until it becomes a $$$r$$$ digit number (for example, if $$$r = 5$$$, then $$$69$$$ becomes $$$00069$$$). This allows us to consider numbers with less than $$$r$$$ digits the same way as numbers with exactly $$$r$$$ digits. For each digit, we have $$$\lfloor \frac{9}{k} \rfloor + 1$$$ choices (including zero), and there are $$$r$$$ digits, so the total number of numbers that satisfies the constraint below $$${10}^r$$$ is $$$(\lfloor \frac{9}{k} \rfloor + 1)^r$$$.
To get the count of numbers in range, it suffices to subtract all valid numbers less than $$$10^l$$$. Therefore, the answer is $$$(\lfloor \frac{9}{k} \rfloor + 1)^r - (\lfloor \frac{9}{k} \rfloor + 1)^l$$$. To exponentiate fast, we can use modular exponentiation.
