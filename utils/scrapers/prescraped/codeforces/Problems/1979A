Alice and Bob came up with a rather strange game. They have an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n$$$. Alice chooses a certain integer $$$k$$$ and tells it to Bob, then the following happens:  Bob chooses two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$), and then finds the maximum among the integers $$$a_i, a_{i + 1},\ldots, a_j$$$;  If the obtained maximum is strictly greater than $$$k$$$, Alice wins, otherwise Bob wins. Help Alice find the maximum $$$k$$$ at which she is guaranteed to win.
