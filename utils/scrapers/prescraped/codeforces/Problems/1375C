You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, which initially is a permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. In one operation, you can choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i < n$$$) such that $$$a_i < a_{i + 1}$$$, and remove either $$$a_i$$$ or $$$a_{i + 1}$$$ from the array (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated). For example, if you have the array $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$, you can choose $$$i = 1$$$ (since $$$a_1 = 1 < a_2 = 3$$$), then either remove $$$a_1$$$ which gives the new array $$$[3, 2]$$$, or remove $$$a_2$$$ which gives the new array $$$[1, 2]$$$.Is it possible to make the length of this array equal to $$$1$$$ with these operations?
