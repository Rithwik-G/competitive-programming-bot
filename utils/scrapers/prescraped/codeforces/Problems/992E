Nastya likes reading and even spends whole days in a library sometimes. Today she found a chronicle of Byteland in the library, and it stated that there lived shamans long time ago. It is known that at every moment there was exactly one shaman in Byteland, and there were n shamans in total enumerated with integers from 1 to n in the order they lived. Also, each shaman had a magic power which can now be expressed as an integer.The chronicle includes a list of powers of the n shamans. Also, some shamans can be king-shamans, if they gathered all the power of their predecessors, i.e. their power is exactly the sum of powers of all previous shamans. Nastya is interested in whether there was at least one king-shaman in Byteland.Unfortunately many of the powers are unreadable in the list, so Nastya is doing the following:  Initially she supposes some power for each shaman.  After that she changes the power of some shaman q times (the shamans can differ) and after that wants to check if there is at least one king-shaman in the list. If yes, she wants to know the index of any king-shaman. Unfortunately the list is too large and Nastya wants you to help her.
