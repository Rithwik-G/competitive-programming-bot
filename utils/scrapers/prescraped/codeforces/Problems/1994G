After winning another Bed Wars game, Masha and Olya wanted to relax and decided to play a new game. Masha gives Olya an array a of length n and a number s. Now Olya's task is to find a non-negative number x such that n∑i=1ai⊕x=s. But she is very tired after a tight round, so please help her with this.But this task seemed too simple to them, so they decided to make the numbers larger (up to 2k) and provide you with their binary representation.
