Bakry got bored of solving problems related to xor, so he asked you to solve this problem for him.You are given an array a of n integers [a1,a2,…,an].Let's call a subarray al,al+1,al+2,…,ar good if al&al+1&al+2…&ar>al⊕al+1⊕al+2…⊕ar, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation and & denotes the bitwise AND operation.Find the length of the longest good subarray of a, or determine that no such subarray exists.
