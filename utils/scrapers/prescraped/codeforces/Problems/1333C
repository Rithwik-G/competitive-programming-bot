Eugene likes working with arrays. And today he needs your help in solving one challenging task.An array c is a subarray of an array b if c can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.Let's call a nonempty array good if for every nonempty subarray of this array, sum of the elements of this subarray is nonzero. For example, array [−1,2,−3] is good, as all arrays [−1], [−1,2], [−1,2,−3], [2], [2,−3], [−3] have nonzero sums of elements. However, array [−1,2,−1,−3] isn't good, as his subarray [−1,2,−1] has sum of elements equal to 0.Help Eugene to calculate the number of nonempty good subarrays of a given array a.
