Nastia has 2 positive integers A and B. She defines that:  The integer is good if it is divisible by Aâ‹…B;  Otherwise, the integer is nearly good, if it is divisible by A. For example, if A=6 and B=4, the integers 24 and 72 are good, the integers 6, 660 and 12 are nearly good, the integers 16, 7 are neither good nor nearly good.Find 3 different positive integers x, y, and z such that exactly one of them is good and the other 2 are nearly good, and x+y=z.
