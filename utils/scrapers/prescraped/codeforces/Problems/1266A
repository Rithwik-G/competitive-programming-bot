Bob is a competitive programmer. He wants to become red, and for that he needs a strict training regime. He went to the annual meeting of grandmasters and asked $$$n$$$ of them how much effort they needed to reach red."Oh, I just spent $$$x_i$$$ hours solving problems", said the $$$i$$$-th of them. Bob wants to train his math skills, so for each answer he wrote down the number of minutes ($$$60 \cdot x_i$$$), thanked the grandmasters and went home. Bob could write numbers with leading zeroes â€” for example, if some grandmaster answered that he had spent $$$2$$$ hours, Bob could write $$$000120$$$ instead of $$$120$$$.Alice wanted to tease Bob and so she took the numbers Bob wrote down, and for each of them she did one of the following independently:   rearranged its digits, or  wrote a random number. This way, Alice generated $$$n$$$ numbers, denoted $$$y_1$$$, ..., $$$y_n$$$.For each of the numbers, help Bob determine whether $$$y_i$$$ can be a permutation of a number divisible by $$$60$$$ (possibly with leading zeroes).
