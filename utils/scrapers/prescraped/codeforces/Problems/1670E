After the last regional contest, Hemose and his teammates finally qualified to the ICPC World Finals, so for this great achievement and his love of trees, he gave you this problem as the name of his team "Hemose 3al shagra" (Hemose on the tree).You are given a tree of n vertices where n is a power of 2. You have to give each node and edge an integer value in the range [1,2nâˆ’1] (inclusive), where all the values are distinct.After giving each node and edge a value, you should select some root for the tree such that the maximum cost of any simple path starting from the root and ending at any node or edge is minimized.The cost of the path between two nodes u and v or any node u and edge e is defined as the bitwise XOR of all the node's and edge's values between them, including the endpoints (note that in a tree there is only one simple path between two nodes or between a node and an edge).
