Subtask 1:
We can directly perform the process according to the problem statement. Maintain
a priority queue of edges between $S$ and $[N]\setminus S$ to find the one with
the minimum label. This will take $O(M\log N)$ time. We should also maintain the
value of $h\pmod{10^9+7}$ rather than $h$ itself. Overall, the runtime is
$O(NM\log N)$.
Subtask 2:
Observe that the edges are chosen according to Prim's algorithm, which will find
a minimum spanning tree.  We can do a first pass to find the minimum spanning
tree and only keep the $N-1$ edges that are part of it.  Then use the solution
of subtask 1 to solve the problem in $O(N^2\log N)$ time.
Subtask 3:
Observe that the edges are selected according to Prim's algorithm, so they will
always form the unique minimum spanning tree of the graph. We need to understand
how the answers for different vertices are related. Assume that instead of the
$h = 10h+e$ operation, $h$ is an array and we append $e$ to it. Given an array,
we can retrieve the original value, e.g. $[1, 20, 9] \mapsto 309$. Then we may
calculate the arrays for all vertices at once using Kruskal's algorithm as
follows:
Initially, every vertex has an empty array.When we have an edge $e = (u, v)$ which connects two components, let $h_u$
and $h_v$ be the current arrays for $u$ and $v$, respectively. First, append $e$
to every vertex in one of the two components. Then append $h_u$ to every vertex
in the connected component of $v$ and vice versa.
This is because when the edge $(u, v)$ is added, the next edges that Prim's
algorithm will explore are exactly what was obtained by starting at $u$. There
are $N-1$ useful edges and we update the $h$ values for $O(N)$ vertices in each
step, but maintaining the whole array adds an extra factor of $N$. Instead of
maintaining the whole array, we maintain the ordered pair of length and value
$\pmod{10^9+7}$. These take $O(1)$ memory and can be combined in $O(1)$ time if
we precalculate the powers of $10$ (see the code for details). The overall time
complexity is $O(N^2+M\alpha(N))$.
Implementation (note that we overload the "+" operator):

Note that in following parts, we will use "value" to refer to these ordered
pairs in the code above and "addition" to the operation that combines them.
Subtask 4:
According to the condition, the connected components will always be consecutive
ranges. We need to be able to obtain the value at a particular point and add a
value on a range. This can be done with a segment tree, solving the problem in
$O(M\log N)$ time. (This is idea is part of full solution 2, so refer to that for
the implementation.)
Full solution 1:
Let's maintain a disjoint-set union with only path compression with the
following invariant: at any point, to obtain the current value at a vertex $v$,
start at $v$ and walk up to the root in the data structure, adding up all the
values along the way in order. Note that we can perform path compression here by
also updating the values as we compress. Recall that to perform an update of
connecting $u$ and $v$, we must add $(1, i) + h_u$ to everything in the
component of $v$ and $(1, i) + h_v$ to everything in the component of $u$, then
combine the components.  This can be done as follows:
Add $h_u$ to the vertex at the root of $v$'s component in the data
structure, and vice versa.Make the two roots children of a new vertex in the data structure with value
$0$. This vertex won't correspond to any of the vertices in the original
graph.
The time complexity of the below implementation is $O(M\log N)$ because we use a
disjoint set union with only path compression, not union by rank. This can be
theoretically improved by using a separate data structure to find the minimum
spanning tree but there is no practical improvement in speed.
Implementation:

Full solution 2:
It turns out that we can relabel the vertices of the tree in such a way that as
we perform Kruskal's algorithm, the connected components are always consecutive
ranges of numbers. First, we explain how to find the relabeling in a first pass
of creating the minimum spanning tree.  For every connected component, maintain
a rightmost vertex and a leftmost vertex. When an edge between $u$ and $v$ is
formed, we declare that the label of the leftmost vertex of $v$'s component will
be one more than the label of the rightmost vertex of $u$'s component. The
leftmost vertex of the combined component is the leftmost vertex of $u$'s
component and the rightmost vertex is the rightmost vertex of $v$'s component.
After forming all these consecutive pairs, we can compute the correct labeling.
With the relabeling, we can use the approach of subtask 4 to solve the problem
in $O(M\log N)$ time.
Implementation:

Full solution 3:
We can actually optimize the solution in subtask 3 using small-to-large merging.
Note that only two different values are being added each time we add an edge
$(u,v)$: $h_u$, and $h_v$. WLOG assume $u$ is in the smaller component by size.
Then, we can normally add $h_v-h_u$ to each node in the component of $u$ and
have a lazy value that tells us to add $h_u$ to each node in the newly merged
component. Because we only add directly to the smaller component, we only do
$O(N\log N)$ additions. We can perform subtraction like this since the $h\mapsto
10h+e$ operation is invertible. Specifically, it inverts to $h\mapsto (h-e)/10$.
This gives a total time complexity of $O(N\log N + M)$.
