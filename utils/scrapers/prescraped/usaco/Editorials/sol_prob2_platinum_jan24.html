Note: let $\texttt{sum}(l, r)$ denote $s_l + s_{l+1} + \dots + s_{r-1} + s_r$.
Subtask 1 ($N\leq 8$)
It suffices to brute force all $(N-1)!$ permutations of merges.
Subtask 2 ($N\leq 100$)
Let's try to calculate the answer for a given cell $c$. At any step, $c$ must be
the label of a cell that represents the sum of a range $[l, r]$ in the original
array. Let $\texttt{dp}[l][r]$ represent the probability that $c$ becomes the
final label if we only consider the cells in the range $[l, r]$. For
transitions, we can consider enumerating the last merge while making sure that
the $c$ remains as the label. Also, note that each of the $r-l$ possible merges
has an equal probability of being the last merge.
The base case is $\texttt{dp}[c][c] = 1$. Otherwise, we have the following:
$$
\texttt{dp}[l][r] =
\sum_{\substack{m\in (l, c] \\ \texttt{sum}(l, m-1)\leq \texttt{sum}(m, r)}}{\frac{1}{r-l}\cdot\texttt{dp}[m][r]} +
\sum_{\substack{m\in [c, r] \\ \texttt{sum}(l, m) > \texttt{sum}(m+1, r)}}{\frac{1}{r-l}\cdot\texttt{dp}[l][m]}

$$
This runs in $\mathcal O(N^3)$ for a single cell $c$, resulting in a
$\mathcal O(N^4)$ solution.
My code:

Subtask 3 ($N\leq 500$)
It is possible to optimize the solution from subtask 2 to $\mathcal O(N^3)$
using prefix sums and two pointers (described more in detail in subtask 4's
notes).
However, I will discuss another approach that is closer to the full solution.
Notice that recalculating the DP for each $c$ can be suboptimal in many ways;
for example, regardless of which label a cell $(l, r)$ contains, it has the same
contribution to $\texttt{dp}[1][N]$. Therefore, let's consider calculating the
DP backwards.
Let $\texttt{dp}[l][r]$ represent the probability that the label of the cell
representing the range $[l, r]$ becomes the label of the final cell after all
merges. The base case is $\texttt{dp}[1][N] = 1$. Otherwise, transitions are
similar to the ones described in the subtask 2 solution:
$$
\texttt{dp}[l][r] =
\sum_{\substack{p\in [1, l) \\ \texttt{sum}(l, r)\geq \texttt{sum}(p, l-1)}}{\frac{1}{r-p}\cdot \texttt{dp}[p][r]} +
\sum_{\substack{p\in (r, N] \\ \texttt{sum}(l, r) > \texttt{sum}(r+1, p)}}{\frac{1}{p-l}\cdot \texttt{dp}[l][p]}

$$
The answer for a cell $c$ is $\texttt{dp}[c][c]$. This runs in
$\mathcal O(N^3)$.
My code:

Subtask 4 $(N\leq 5000$)
Let's try to accelerate the solution from subtask 3. For example, say the last
merge is leftwards. We query the sum of $\frac{\texttt{dp}[p][r]}{r-p}$ over a fixed $r$ and
a range of $p$. The range of $p$ is determined by the leftmost position such
that $\texttt{sum}(l, r)\geq \texttt{sum}(p, l-1)$ holds. Let this bound be
denoted as $\texttt{pL}[l][r]$. It can be proven that
$\texttt{pL}[l][r]\leq \texttt{pL}[l+1][r]$, which allows us to compute all
$\texttt{pL}[l][r]$ in $\mathcal O(N^2)$ time using two pointers. Next, to
calculate the sum, we need a data-structure that can support adding
$\frac{\texttt{dp}[l][r]}{r-l}$ and querying the sum over
$p\in [\texttt{pL}[l][r], l)$. Since we enumerate ranges in decreasing order of
size, for a fixed $r$, $\frac{\texttt{dp}[l][r]}{r-l}$ is added in increasing order of $l$.
This allows us to maintain prefix sums and answer range sum queries in constant
time.
This runs in $\mathcal O(N^2)$. My code:

The code above uses around $5N^2$ memory. It's possible to optimize this to
$N^2$ by just storing the DP array while maintaining $\texttt{pL}[l][r]$,
$\texttt{pR}[l][r]$, and the range sums in 1D arrays.
