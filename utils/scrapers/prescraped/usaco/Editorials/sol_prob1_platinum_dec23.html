In all solutions, the overall time complexity will be $Q$ times the time
complexity to answer a single query.
First, let $I$ be the set of infected cows and let $T$ be the number of nights
in a given query. We first analyze whether or not $I$ is even a valid
configuration. Note that a cow $v$ can start out infected if and only if the set
$B_T(v) = \{u \colon d(u, v) \leq T\}$ is  contained entirely in $I$. Let $S$ be
the set of cows that can start out infected. Then, $I$ is a valid configuration
if and only if $I = \bigcup_{v\in S} B_T(v)$. Furthermore, when $I$ is a valid
configuration, we want to find the smallest possible subset $S'\subseteq S$ 
such that $\bigcup_{v\in S'} B_T(v) = I$.
To compute the set $S$, we need to know the shortest distance from each cow to
its closest non-infected cow. This can be done in $O(N)$ time by starting a
multisource BFS from all non-infected cows.
Subtask 1 ($N = 10$):
For this case, we can just brute force through all subsets $S'$ of $S$. For each
$v\in S'$, we can do a BFS to find $B_T(v)$, and check if the resulting sets
cover $I$. This takes $O(2^N \cdot N^2)$ time per query.
Brandon's code:

Subtask 2 (all cows infected):
We can answer each query in $O(N)$ time using a greedy strategy. First, some
definitions: 
"Choosing" a cow means that we set it to be initially infected.A cow is "covered" if it is within a distance $T$ of some chosen cow.
Our goal in this subtask is to choose the minimum number of cows so that all
cows are covered.
Root the tree at any cow (the solution code roots the tree at the first cow). 
The following greedy procedure covers all the cows in $c$'s subtree at a
distance at least $T$ away from $c$:
Recursively apply the procedure to the subtrees of $c$'s children.Compute the distance from $c$ to its farthest uncovered descendant
(guaranteed to be at most $T$).If the distance in step 2 is exactly $T$, choose cow $c$. Now, all cows in
$c$'s subtree are covered.Special case: If $c$ is the root and there is an uncovered descendant of
$c$, choose $c$.Return the distance from $c$ to its farthest uncovered descendant if such a
descendant exists (such a descendant will later be covered by some cow outside
of $c$'s subtree), or otherwise the distance from $c$ to its closest chosen
descendant (this descendant has the potential to cover cows outside of $c$'s
subtree).
In addition, this procedure constructs an optimal solution because 
If the distance from step 2 is less than $T$, and $c$ is not the root of the
tree, it is always at least as good to choose the parent of $c$ instead of $c$,
since choosing the parent of $c$ will cover all the uncovered cows inside of
$c$'s subtree and more cows outside of $c$'s subtree. Thus, we should not choose
$c$.If the distance from step 2 is exactly $T$ and we have already fixed which
cows to choose in each of the child subtrees, then cow $c$ is the only cow that
can cover the uncovered descendant, so we must choose $c$.
Ben's code:

Subtask 3 ($N\leq 400$) Solution 1 (DP):
Our approach for the remaining subtasks will be to use a tree-dp type approach. 
As in the subtask 2 solution, root the tree arbitrarily. Unfortunately, just
making the DP state "min # of originally infected cows to cover subtree of $v$" 
does not provide enough info, because we can cover infected nodes in a subtree
via starting cows outside the subtree.
Instead, for each $0 \leq t \leq T$, we store the following:
 The min number of nodes we need to pick in the subtree such that all
infected cows with distance $\ge t$ from the subtree root are covered, and  The min number of nodes we need to pick in the subtree such that all
infected cows are covered, plus our coverage extends distance $t$ outside the
tree as well.
We can compute each of these in $O(\# \text{children})$ time given the
children's DP states,  so this takes a total of $O(TN)$ per query. Since
$T\leq N$, this takes $O(N^2)$, which runs in time.
Subtask 3 Solution 2 (Greedy):
We will describe an algorithm where initially we start with no chosen cows,  and
we greedily choose cows in $S$ until every infected cow is covered. 
Define $U$ to be the set of nodes that have not been covered yet. Root the tree
arbitrarily and consider the highest depth infected cow $c \in U$, where depth
is defined as distance from the root. 
Let $S_c$ be all elements of $S$ that are distance within $T$ of $c$. Clearly,
we must choose some element $s \in S_c$.
We claim that we can greedily choose the lowest depth node $s' \in S_c$. 
Consider some other node $s \in S_c$. For our greedy to be correct, it suffices
to show that for all nodes $u \in U$, if $s$ covers $u$, then $s'$ also covers
$u$.
This is easy to prove if $s$ and $s'$ are both ancestors of $c$. Now, suppose
one of them is not an ancestor of $c$. Define $l = lca(c, s)$ and
$l' = lca(c, s')$. Notice that $s$ covers all uncovered nodes $u \in U$ that are
also in the subtree rooted at $l$ because $c$ is the highest depth uncovered
node, and similarly $s'$ covers all uncovered nodes in the subtree rooted at
$l'$. From this, one can prove that $s$ covers the same uncovered nodes as the
unique node with the same depth as $s$ which is also an ancestor of $c$.
Combining this with the proof for the case where $s$ and $s'$ are both ancestors
of $c$, the greedy is proven.
So, the algorithm is to repeatedly find the highest depth node $c$ that has not
been covered, and choose the lowest depth node in $S_c$ to cover it. This can be
done naively in $O(N^2)$ per query (though on most test cases, it runs much
faster than this worst-case bound would suggest).
Richard's code: 

Full Solution 1:
We will answer each query in $O(N)$. This solution follows from  generalizing
the subtask 2 greedy solution or removing unnecessary states from the subtask 3
DP solution (it turns out that we need to keep at most two states for each
subtree). For a node $v$, let $closest_S(v)$ denote the distance from $v$ to its
closest node in
$S$.
For any vertex $v$, let $I_v$ be the set of infected cows in $v$'s subtree, and
let $S_v$ be the set of source cows in $v$'s subtree. In addition, let $I_v'$ be
the set of infected cows in $v$'s subtree that are distance greater than
$T-closest_S(parent_v)$ away from $parent_v$. When all cows are infected, $I_v'$
is precisely the set of all cows in $v$'s subtree distance at least $T$ away
from $v$.  Observe that every node in $I_v'$ must be covered by some node
inside $v$'s subtree, and every node in $I_v\setminus I_v'$ would be covered by
choosing the closest cow to $parent_v$. Intuitively, $I_v\setminus I_v'$ is the
set of all cows in $v$'s subtree that might be covered by some node outside of
$v$'s subtree (though they might instead be covered by some node inside $v$'s
subtree).
Let $f(v)$ be the smallest number of nodes in $S_v$ we need to pick so that
every node in $I_v'$ is covered. Clearly $f(v) \geq \sum_{u\in C_v} f(u)$. In
fact the following is also true:
Lemma: $f(v) \leq 1 + \sum_{u\in C_v} f(u)$.
Proof: We will show that all of $I_v$ can be covered by at most
$1 + \sum_{u\in C_v} f(u)$ source nodes (one of which need not be in $v$'s
subtree). Choosing all of these source nodes (excluding any outside of $v$'s
subtree) would cover $I_v'$.
Suppose that, in each subtree, we pick $f(u)$ sources in $S_u$ that cover
$I_u'$, and also we are in the best possible DP state (states are defined in the
solution above). Here, "every infected node in $u$'s subtree is covered, as is
everything distance $T$ outside of $u$" is the best case, followed by "every
infected node in $u$'s subtree is covered, as is everything distance $T-1$
outside of $u$", etc.,  and then "every infected node $u$'s subtree is covered,
but nothing outside the subtree is" is better than  "every infected node in
$u$'s subtree is covered except $u$", which is better than "the deepest
uncovered infected node is at depth 1", which is better than "the deepest
uncovered infected node is at depth 2", etc.
Now, suppose $u_1, \ldots, u_k$ are the children such that
$I_{u_1}, \ldots, I_{u_k}$ are not fully covered. Suppose their deepest
uncovered children are at depth $d_1, \ldots, d_k$, respectively with respect to
$v$.  Without loss of generality suppose $d_1 = \max(d_1, \ldots, d_k)$. By
assumption,  there exists some source node $w$ such that
$d(w, parent_{u_1})=d(w,v) \leq T - d_1$. Then, $d(w, v) \leq T-d_i$ for every
$i$, so adding $w$ to the set of sources covers all of $I_v$. This completes the
proof (note that $w$ covers $v$ if needed also). $\Box$
Since the answer to the query is just $f(\text{root})$, we just need to figure
out when the difference $f(v) - \sum_{u\in C_v} f(u)$ is $0$ or $1$. To do this,
when computing the DP, we additionally store what the "best case" is. We can do
this in $O(\#\text{children})$ for each node with some preprocessing. Then, the
difference is one precisely when there is an uncovered node in $I_v'$, in which
case we can choose the closest node in $S$ to $v$. This newly chosen node is
guaranteed to cover all uncovered nodes in $I_v$ (any nodes in $v$'s subtree not
covered by this new node are part of $I_c'$ for some child $c$ of $v$, which
should have been covered already). Note that due to our earlier observation
about $I_v'$, this node will be in $v$'s subtree.
Ben's code:

Full Solution 2:
We can use centroid decomposition in 
the subtask 3 greedy solution to answer queries in $O(N\log{N})$.
Specifically, using centroid decomposition, we can do the following tasks.
In $O(N\log N)$ time, for every node $v$, find the minimum depth node  $s$
within distance $T$ of $v$ satisfying $s \in S$.In $O(\log N)$ time, mark a node as chosen.In $O(\log N)$ time, compute the distance from a node to its nearest chosen
node.
We leave the details as an exercise to the reader.
