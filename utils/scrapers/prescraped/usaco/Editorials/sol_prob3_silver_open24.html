Subtask 1: $N \leq 100$ ($O(N^5)$)
For this problem, we can apply a brute force to simulate the process described
in the problem statement for every $(K,L)$ pair. We can iterate through all $K$
length substrings, and find the lexicographic minimum out of all $L$ length
substrings contained within. We can then count the number of unique "winning"
gene positions and add it to a larger array.
Note that while the time complexity of this brute force is $O(N^5)$, there is a
small fractional constant factor due to the restrictions on $K$ and $L$ and the
number of valid substrings given $K$, so $N=100$ runs comfortably in the TL.  
Benjamin Qi's Python code:

Subtask 1 / 2: $N \leq 500$ ($O(N^4)$)
For this subtask, we can switch how we think about this problem. Instead of
determining how many "winning" gene positions a given $(K,L)$ pair has, we can
instead focus on some position $p_i$ and determine which $(K,L)$ pairs that
$p_i$ is a "winning" position for.
Let us fix some position $p_i$ and some length $L$. We want to determine what
conditions on $K$ are necessary for $p_i$ to be a winning position. The first
observation we can make is that $p_i$ is a winning position as long as there
exists some window of $K$ characters where $S[p_i:p_i+L]$ is lexicographically
minimal. Let $a_i$ be the maximum position such that  $a_i < p_i$ and
$S[a_i:a_i+L] \leq S[p_i:p_i+L]$ and let $b_i$ be the minimum positions such
that $b_i > p_i$ and $S[b_i:b_i+L] < S[p_i:p_i+L]$ (note our first equation uses
$\leq$ due to the tiebreaker condition favoring smaller indices). 
We can always identify a window of $K$ characters where $p_i$ is winning as long
as our window doesn't "include" the ranges $[a_i:a_i+L]$ and $[b_i:b_i+L]$. In
other words, any $K$ where $K \leq (b_i+L)-a_i-2$ makes $p_i$ a winning
position.
Now that we have identified how to determine valid $K$ given $p_i$ and $L$, we
can create our solution from here. We can iterate over all $p_i$ and $L$. To
determine $a_i$ and $b_i$, we can iterate over all $L$ length substrings until
we identify $a_i$ or $b_i$ that satisfy the above conditions. If none exist, we
can use $-1$ for $a_i$ and $N$ for $b_i$. 
Since we iterate over the string to find $a_i$ and $b_i$ for every position
$p_i$ and length $L$, and we call the substring function repeatedly, the time
complexity of this solution is $O(N^4)$. However, this ends up running fast
enough to pass subtask 2 in practice.
My Java code:

Subtask 2 / Subtask 3 Partial: $O(N^3)$
To improve on the last subtask, we want to improve our compare function. To do
this, we can precompute a longest common prefix (lcp) array that stores
for positions $i$ and $j$ the  largest value $k$ such that
$S[i:i+k] = S[j:j+k]$. If we had this array, we could compare any two substrings
at positions $i$ and $j$ in $O(1)$ without using the substring function by 
comparing the characters at $S[i+lcp[i][j]]$ and $S[j+lcp[i][j]]$ or returning a
tie if $lcp[i][j] \geq k$ (since we only take the first $k$ characters at both
positions.
To compute this array, we can naively compute this array by finding the lcp for
every pair of indices.
Now that the cost of comparing strings is reduced, we need to improve the
complexity of computing valid $K$ for every value of $L$. The first observation
we make is that $a_i$ is monotonically decreasing for increasing value of $L$.
Suppose this was not the case. This would mean that for some $L_1 < L_2$,
$S[a_i:a_i+L_1] > S[p_i:p_i+L_1]$ but $S[a_i:a_i+L_2] \leq 
S[p_i:p_i+L_2]$. If one string is less than another string of equal length, 
this will continue to hold even if we extend both strings by a character, so we
form a contradiction here.
Similarly we can make the same observation for $b_i$. Since it would be
monotonically decreasing for increasing values of $L$, it would be monotonically
increasing for decreasing values of $L$. Consequently, we can compute $a_i$ and
$b_i$ for every value of $L$ in $O(N)$ using a pointer.
Finally, in our previous solution we used a for loop to set every value of
$L \leq k \leq b_i+L-a_i-2$ as valid. Instead, we can use prefix sums to
increment a range up to $b_i+L-a_i-2$ in $O(1)$. While most of our computation
is quick, we are bottlenecked by the LCP computation, so this solution runs in
$O(N^3)$.
Depending on your implementation, you might also be able to pass many of the
last batch of test cases using a solution of this complexity.
My Java code:

Full Solution
To speed up our solution to $O(N^2)$, we need to speed up our LCP array
precomputation. However, instead of computing it naively, we can avoid  extra
computations by leveraging the following property. If we know $LCP[i+1][j+1]$,
we can determine $LCP[i][j]$ depending on if character $i$ is equal to character
$j$. This motivates working backwards to compute LCP, using the following
recurrence.
