Bessie and Elsie are playing a game of Moorbles. The game works as follows:
Bessie and Elsie each start out with some amount of marbles. Bessie holds out
$A$ of her marbles in her hoof and Elsie guesses if $A$ is Even or Odd. If Elsie
is correct, she wins the $A$ marbles from Bessie and if she guesses incorrectly,
she loses $A$ of her marbles to Bessie (if Elsie has less than $A$ marbles, she
loses all her marbles). A player loses when they lose all of their marbles.

After some amount of turns in the game, Elsie has $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 10^9)$
marbles. She thinks it is hard to win, but she is playing to not lose. After
being around Bessie enough, Elsie has a good read on Bessie's habits and
recognizes that on turn $i$, there are only $K$ $(1 \leq K \leq 4)$ different
amounts of marbles that Bessie may put out. There are only $M$
$(1 \leq M \leq 3 \cdot 10^5)$ turns before Bessie gets bored and stops playing.
Can you identify a lexicographically minimum turn sequence such that Elsie will
not lose, regardless of how Bessie plays?

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 10$) representing
the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows:
 First, one line containing three integers $N$, $M$, and $K$, representing
the number of marbles Elsie has, the number of turns, and the number of
potential moves Bessie can make respectively.Then, $M$ lines where
line $i$ contains $K$ distinct space separated integers
$a_{i,1} \; a_{i,2} \ldots a_{i,K}$ ($1 \leq a_{i, j} \leq 10^3$) representing
the possible amounts of marbles that Bessie might play on turn $i$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $M$ over all test cases is at most
$3 \cdot 10^5$.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
For each test case, output the lexicographically minimum move sequence for Elsie
to guarantee not losing, or $-1$ if she will lose. The move sequence should be
on a single line and consist of $M$ space-separated tokens each equal to either
"Even" or "Odd".

Note: "Even" is lexicographically smaller than "Odd".

SCORING:
Input 3: $M \leq 16$.Inputs 4-6: $M \leq 1000$.Inputs
7-12: No further constraints.
