To improve her mathematical knowledge, Bessie has been taking a graph theory
course and finds herself stumped by the following problem.  Please help her!

You are given a connected, undirected graph with vertices labeled $1\dots N$ and
edges labeled $1\dots M$ ($2\le N\le 2\cdot 10^5$, $N-1\le M\le 4\cdot 10^5$).
For each vertex $v$ in the graph, the following process is conducted:
​
Let $S=\{v\}$ and $h=0$.While $|S|<N$, 
​
Out of all edges with exactly one endpoint in $S$, let $e$ be the edge with
the minimum label.Add the endpoint of $e$ not in $S$ to $S$.Set $h=10h+e$.
​
Return $h\pmod{10^9+7}$.
​
Determine all the return values of this process.
​
INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains $N$ and $M$.
​
Then follow $M$ lines, the $e$th containing the endpoints $(a_e,b_e)$ of the 
$e$th edge ($1\le a_e<b_e\le N$). It is guaranteed that these edges form a
connected graph, and at most one edge connects each pair of vertices.

​
OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output $N$ lines, where the $i$th line should contain the return value of the
process starting at vertex $i$.

SCORING:
Input 4: $N,M\le 2000$Inputs 5-6: $N\le 2000$Inputs 7-10: $N\le 10000$Inputs 11-14: $a_e+1=b_e$ for all $e$Inputs 15-23: No additional constraints.
