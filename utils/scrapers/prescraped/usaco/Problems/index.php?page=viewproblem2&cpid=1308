Bessie is a hungry cow. Each day, for dinner, if there is a haybale in the barn,
she will eat one haybale. Farmer John does not want Bessie to starve, so some
days he sends a delivery of haybales, which arrive in the morning (before
dinner). In particular, on day $d_i$, Farmer John sends a delivery of $b_i$
haybales ($1\leq d_i \leq 10^{14}$, $0\leq b_i \leq 10^9$).

Process $U$ ($1\le U\le 10^5$) updates as follows: Given a pair  $(d, b)$, 
update the number of haybales arriving on day $d$ to $b$.  After each update,
output the sum of all days on which Bessie eats haybales modulo
$10^9+7$.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
$U$, followed by $U$ lines containing the updates.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
The sum after each update modulo $10^9+7$.

SCORING:
Input 3: $U\le 5000$Inputs 4-10: Updates only increase the number of haybales arriving on day
$d$.Inputs 11-22: No additional constraints.
