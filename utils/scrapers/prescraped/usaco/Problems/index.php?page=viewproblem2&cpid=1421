Farmer John has a permutation $p$ of length $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 10^5)$,
containing each positive integer from $1$ to $N$ exactly once. However, Farmer
Nhoj has broken into FJ's barn and disassembled $p$. To not be too cruel, FN has
written some hints that will help FJ reconstruct $p$. While there is more than
one element remaining in $p$, FN does the following:

Let the remaining elements of $p$ be
$p'_1, p'_2, \dots , p'_n$,
 If $p'_1 > p'_n$, he writes down $p'_2$ and removes $p'_1$ from the
permutation. Otherwise, he writes down $p'_{n-1}$ and removes $p'_n$ from the
permutation.
At the end, Farmer Nhoj will have written down $N - 1$ integers
$h_1, h_2, \dots, h_{N-1}$, in that order. Given $h$, Farmer John wants to
enlist your help to reconstruct the lexicographically minimum $p$ consistent
with Farmer Nhoj's hints, or determine that Farmer Nhoj must have made a
mistake.  Recall that if you are given two permutations $p$ and $p'$,
$p$ is lexicographically smaller than $p'$ if $p_i < p'_i$ at the first
position $i$ where the two differ.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
Each input consists of $T$ independent test cases ($1\le T\le 10$). Each test
case is described as follows:

The first line contains $N$.

The second line contains $N - 1$ integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_{N-1}$
($1\le h_i\le N$).

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output $T$ lines, one for each test case.

If there is a permutation $p$ of $1\dots N$ consistent with $h$, output the
lexicographically smallest such $p$. If no such $p$ exists, output $-1$.

SCORING:
Input 2: $N\le 8$Inputs 3-6: $N\le 100$Inputs 7-11: No additional constraints.
