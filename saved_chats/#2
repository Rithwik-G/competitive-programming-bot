USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: i know the answer is easy when you have a 0, but i can't think of any other cases.

BOT: You're correct that the presence of a `0` simplifies the problem significantly. Let's consider the other cases:

1. **All digits are `1`:** If every digit in the string is `1`, the minimum result is `1`. This is because multiplying any number of `1`s together will always result in `1`.

2. **No `0`s and not all `1`s:** In this case, the key is to avoid multiplying numbers greater than `1` with each other as it increases the result. Instead, you should sum these numbers to minimize the result. 

Would you like a more detailed hint on how to handle the case where there are no `0`s and not all digits are `1`?



USER: ah i see thanks!

BOT: You're welcome! It looks like you're on the right track. Here's a small hint to continue guiding you:

When there are no `0`s and not all digits are `1`, focus on summing the numbers that are greater than `1` to minimize the result. Multiplying numbers greater than `1` will increase the result, so it's better to add them.
