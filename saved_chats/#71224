USER: i know the subarray length has to be even. i also think that i can iterate over the msb of the bitwise and, but i don't know how to check if the xor has a larger bit set. can i use a binary trie for this?

BOT: The idea of iterating over the MSB of the bitwise AND is on the right track. To check if the XOR has a larger bit set, you can use prefix arrays to keep track of the XOR values up to each index, considering only the important bits.

For a hint: Focus on creating a prefix array where each entry represents the XOR of elements up to that index, considering only the bits more significant than the current bit you are examining. This will help you determine if the XOR of any subarray has a larger bit set.

Would you like a more detailed explanation on how to construct and use this prefix array?

BOT: Using a binary trie is not mentioned as part of the solution approach in the editorial. Instead, the solution involves using prefix arrays to keep track of the XOR values up to each index, considering only the important bits.

Would you like a more detailed hint on how to use these prefix arrays to solve the problem?
