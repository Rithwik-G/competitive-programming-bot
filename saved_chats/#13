BOT: Would you like hints to help you solve the problem or an interactive explanation of the editorial (hint/editorial)? 



USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: add all the consecutive differences of array elements

BOT: Your thoughts are not in the editorial.



USER: take the difference between first and last element of array

BOT: You are thinking in the right direction. Focus on the relationship between the first and last elements of the array.



USER: check if first element is smaller than last element, if yes, then the answer should be yes

BOT: Correct. If the first element is smaller than the last element, then it is possible to reduce the array to a single element. Would you like a more detailed explanation of why this works?



USER: find the sum of consecutive differences of array elements, if the sum is positive, answer should be yes

BOT: Your thoughts are not in the editorial.



USER: please tell the editorial of the question

BOT: The solution to the problem is based on the relationship between the first and last elements of the array. Specifically, the answer is "yes" if and only if the first element of the array is smaller than the last element. Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. **When $a_1 < a_n$**:
   - You can repeatedly use the following algorithm while the permutation contains more than one element:
     - Find the smallest index $r$ such that $a_1 < a_r$.
     - Choose $a_r$ and the element that comes right before $a_r$, and delete the element before $a_r$.
     - Repeat this process until $a_r$ is adjacent to $a_1$.
     - Finally, choose $a_1$ and $a_r$, and delete $a_r$.

2. **When $a_1 > a_n$**:
   - The leftmost element is non-decreasing because if you want to remove the old leftmost element $a_1$, you need to pair it with $a_2 > a_1$, which results in the leftmost element increasing.
   - Similarly, the rightmost element is non-increasing because of the same argument applied to the rightmost element.

Would you like further elaboration on any specific part of this explanation?



USER: how does choosing a1 < ar lead to the solution of a1 , an being sufficient and necessary condition for answer to be 'YES'

BOT: When $a_1 < a_n$, it is possible to always find a sequence of operations that will reduce the array to a single element. Here's why:

1. **Finding $a_r$**: By finding the smallest index $r$ such that $a_1 < a_r$, you ensure that you can always remove elements in a way that keeps $a_1$ in the array.
2. **Removing Elements**: By choosing $a_r$ and the element before it, and then removing the element before $a_r$, you effectively bring $a_r$ closer to $a_1$.
3. **Repeat**: You repeat this process until $a_r$ is adjacent to $a_1$. At this point, you can choose $a_1$ and $a_r$ and remove $a_r$, thus keeping $a_1$ in the array.
4. **Final Step**: Continue this process until only $a_1$ remains.

Since $a_1 < a_n$ allows you to always find such an $a_r$ and perform the necessary operations, it guarantees that you can reduce the array to a single element. Conversely, if $a_1 > a_n$, the leftmost element will keep increasing and the rightmost element will keep decreasing, making it impossible to reduce the array to a single element.

Would you like a more detailed explanation of any specific step?



FEEDBACK: Here, it would have been better if the steps (1-4) were omitted from the second response, since they were already stated earlier. Instead, directly the last statement "Since a1 < an allows you to..." would have sufficed.
