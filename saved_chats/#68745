BOT: Thanks! Now could you provide a link to the editorial.

BOT: Would you like hints to help you solve the problem or an interactive explanation of the editorial (hint/editorial)? 



USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: loop through the array from the second element and if the current value is less than the previous element we can divide the previous element on the current element and add 1 and sum the value to variable called sum

BOT: Your approach of looping through the array and comparing the current value with the previous one is on the right track. However, instead of dividing the previous element by the current element, you might want to consider how many times you need to multiply the current element by 2 to make it at least as large as the previous element. 

Would you like a small hint to refine your approach?



USER: what if i just make a brute force solution somrthing like this #include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
#define fast_io ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);
void solve(){
  int n;
  cin>>n;
  vector<int>arr(n);
  for(int i=0;i<n;++i){cin>>arr[i];}
  if(n==1){cout<<0<<'\n';return;}
  long long ans=0;
  for(int i=1;i<n;++i){
    while(arr[i]<arr[i-1]){
        arr[i]*=2;
        ans+=1;
    }
  }
  cout<<ans<<'\n';
}
int main() {
    fast_io;
 
    #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
        freopen("input2.txt", "r", stdin);
    #endif
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    while (T--) 
        solve();
}

BOT: Your brute force solution correctly identifies the need to multiply elements to make the array non-decreasing. However, it might be inefficient for large inputs because it repeatedly multiplies elements and checks the condition.

Would you like a hint on how to optimize this approach using the concept of representing each element as a product of its original value and a power of 2?



USER: yes

BOT: Instead of multiplying the elements directly, you can represent each element as $a_i \cdot 2^{x_i}$, where $x_i$ is the power to which you need to multiply the element. This way, you can calculate the minimum number of operations needed by adjusting $x_i$ based on the previous element's value.

Would you like a more detailed hint on how to implement this approach?
