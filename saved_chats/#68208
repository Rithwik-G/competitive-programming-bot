USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: I know the subarray length has to be even. I also think that I can iterate over the MSB of the bitwise AND, but i don't know how to check if the XOR has a larger bit set. Can I use a binary trie for this?

BOT: Using a binary trie is not necessary for this problem. Instead, focus on the conditions that need to be met for a subarray to be considered "good." 

Here's a small hint to guide you in the right direction: 

To ensure that the XOR of the subarray does not have a larger bit set than the AND of the subarray, you can use prefix arrays to keep track of the prefix XOR and prefix AND up to each index. This will help you efficiently check the conditions for each possible subarray.

Would you like a more detailed hint on how to implement this approach?
