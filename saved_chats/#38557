USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: do you need DP for this problem?

BOT: Yes, DP (Dynamic Programming) is required to solve this problem.



USER: range DP?

BOT: Yes, range DP is required to solve this problem.



USER: cool uh can you explain the sol

BOT: Sure, here's an explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the DP State**: Let `dp[l][r]` represent the probability that the label of the cell representing the range `[l, r]` becomes the label of the final cell after all merges.

2. **Base Case**: The base case is when the range is a single cell, i.e., `dp[i][i] = 1` for all `i` from 1 to N.

3. **Transitions**: For each range `[l, r]`, we need to consider the last merge operation that happens within this range. There are two cases:
   - The last merge happens to the left of the cell `c` (where `c` is the label we are interested in).
   - The last merge happens to the right of the cell `c`.

   We need to ensure that the cell `c` remains the label after the merge. This can be done by checking the sums of the segments being merged.

4. **Probability Calculation**: For each possible last merge position, we calculate the probability contribution to `dp[l][r]` from the subproblems. Each possible merge has an equal probability of being the last merge.

5. **Summing Up**: Sum up the contributions from all possible last merge positions to get the value of `dp[l][r]`.

6. **Result Extraction**: The answer for each cell `i` is given by `dp[i][i]`.
