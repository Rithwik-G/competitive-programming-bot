BOT: Would you like hints to help you solve the problem or an interactive explanation of the editorial (hint/editorial)? 



USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: swap the double sum, also only prime numbers contribute to the sum

BOT: Yes, swapping the double sum and focusing on prime numbers is a good direction. 

Hint: Consider how Wilson's Theorem can help simplify the calculation for prime numbers. This theorem states that for a prime $ p $, $(p-1)! \equiv -1 \mod p $. This can be useful in determining $ C(i, j) \mod j $ when $ j $ is prime. 

Would you like more elaboration on this hint?



USER: can you confirm that the terms for composite numbers are zero

BOT: Yes, for composite numbers $ j $, $ C(i, j) \mod j $ is zero, except for $ j = 4 $. This is because the factorial of $ j-1 $ will include all proper factors of $ j $, making the product divisible by $ j $. 

Would you like more elaboration on this point?



USER: for the above hint, i know that C(i,j) mod j = -(i choose j) mod j when j is prime.

BOT: Great, you're on the right track! 

Hint: To efficiently compute the contributions of each prime, consider using a prefix sum array. This will help you manage the updates for each prime $ p $ and their multiples within the range.

Would you like more details on how to implement this?



USER: ill come back. thanks

BOT: You're welcome! Feel free to come back anytime if you need more help or have further questions. Good luck!
