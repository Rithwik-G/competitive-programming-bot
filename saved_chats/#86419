USER: a hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: I just need to find any token which has a path to node 1 with all nodes on the path being bonuses. And i can do this with dijkstra

BOT: Your idea of using Dijkstra's algorithm to find a path to node 1 with all nodes on the path being bonuses aligns with the solution approach. You're thinking in the right direction!

Hint: To proceed, consider how you can utilize the bonuses to extend your moves and how to handle the connected components of vertices with bonuses. This will help you determine the feasibility of reaching node 1.



USER: explain the answer to me

BOT: Sure, let's break down the solution step by step:

1. **Identify the Shortest Paths**: First, calculate the shortest paths from all vertices to the finish vertex (vertex 1) considering only the vertices that contain bonuses. This can be done using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm where you only traverse through vertices that have bonuses.

2. **Find the Closest Token**: Identify the token that is closest to the finish vertex. If there is no such token, it means you cannot reach the finish vertex, and thus you lose.

3. **Connected Components of Bonuses**: Find all connected components of vertices that contain bonuses. This helps in identifying which tokens can provide additional moves.

4. **Extra Moves Calculation**: For each connected component of bonuses, determine the tokens that are either in the component or adjacent to it. These tokens can provide extra moves.

5. **Component Size Analysis**: Analyze the size of each connected component:
   - If the size is 1, a token in an adjacent vertex provides 1 extra move.
   - If the size is greater than 1, tokens in the component or adjacent to it can move indefinitely, providing unlimited moves.

6. **Compare Moves and Distance**: Finally, compare the number of extra moves you have with the shortest distance to the finish vertex. If the extra moves are sufficient to reach the finish vertex, you win.
