**Tutorial**
We shift the perspective to see the pattern from $$$\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor$$$, instead of $$$x$$$, to see what kind of patterns are needed so $$$x$$$ can be luxurious.
Note that: $$${(a + 1)}^2 - 1 = a * (a + 2)$$$.
Therefore, every half-closed segment $$$[a^2, (a + 1) ^ 2)$$$ contains  $$$3$$$ luxurious number: $$$a^2$$$, $$$a * (a + 1)$$$ and $$$a * (a + 2)$$$.
Also note that, since large numbers can cause inaccuracies in floating point computation, we should use binary search to find the floor-value of a square root, instead of using the sqrt function in any language.

**Solution snippet (low_, C++)**
Let me know if you have any questions.



USER: didn't get the intuition behind the solution

BOT: The key insight in solving this problem lies in understanding the pattern of luxurious numbers based on the floor value of their square roots. For any integer $ x $, if we denote $ \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor $ as $ a $, then $ x $ is a luxurious number if $ x $ is divisible by $ a $. By examining the ranges of $ x $ where $ \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor $ is constant, we can identify specific luxurious numbers. For any integer $ a $, the interval $[a^2, (a+1)^2)$ contains three luxurious numbers: $ a^2 $, $ a \cdot (a+1) $, and $ a \cdot (a+2) $. This pattern arises because these numbers are all divisible by $ a $.

To efficiently determine the count of luxurious numbers between any two given days $ l $ and $ r $, we can leverage this pattern. Instead of checking each number individually, we can identify the ranges where $ \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor $ remains constant and count the luxurious numbers within those ranges. This approach avoids the inaccuracies of floating-point computations by using integer arithmetic and binary search to find the floor values of square roots. By systematically counting the luxurious numbers in each relevant interval, we can quickly determine the total count between $ l $ and $ r $.



USER: explain with examples

BOT: To understand the solution, let's consider the pattern of luxurious numbers within specific intervals. For example, take $ a = 2 $. The interval $[2^2, (2+1)^2)$ or $[4, 9)$ includes the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Within this interval, the luxurious numbers are $ 2^2 = 4 $, $ 2 \cdot (2+1) = 6 $, and $ 2 \cdot (2+2) = 8 $. These numbers are divisible by $ \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor = 2 $. Similarly, for $ a = 3 $, the interval $[3^2, (3+1)^2)$ or $[9, 16)$ includes the numbers 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, with luxurious numbers being $ 3^2 = 9 $, $ 3 \cdot (3+1) = 12 $, and $ 3 \cdot (3+2) = 15 $.

To count the luxurious numbers between any two days $ l $ and $ r $, we identify the relevant intervals and count the luxurious numbers within each. For instance, if $ l = 5 $ and $ r = 14 $, we see that $ \lfloor \sqrt{5} \rfloor = 2 $ and $ \lfloor \sqrt{14} \rfloor = 3 $. We count luxurious numbers in the interval $[5, 9)$ for $ a = 2 $ and $[9, 15)$ for $ a = 3 $. From the previous examples, we know that 6 and 8 are luxurious in $[5, 9)$, and 9, 12, and 15 are luxurious in $[9, 15)$. By summing these, we find the total luxurious numbers between 5 and 14. This method efficiently counts luxurious numbers by leveraging the predictable pattern within each interval.
