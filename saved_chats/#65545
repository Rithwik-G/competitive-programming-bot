USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: I know the subarray length has to be even. I also think that I can iterate over the MSB of the bitwise AND, but i don't know how to check if the XOR has a larger bit set. Can i use a binary trie for this?

BOT: Your thoughts are not in the editorial.
