BOT: Would you like hints to help you solve the problem or an interactive explanation of the editorial (hint/editorial)? 



USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: My first observation is that we can define contributing vertices as those that are < the MEX of their component. The answer is then contributing vertices + # of components, right? From here, we initialize every edge as its own node, and then merge edges with adjacent edges that form paths while the MEX of the merged path does not increase. I'm not sure if this solution is correct, and if it is I can't prove that is optimal.

BOT: Your thoughts are not in the editorial.



USER: Can you give me a small hint to help me proceed?

BOT: Consider using dynamic programming (DP) to solve the problem. Define a DP state that helps you track the minimum result of the MEX of paths extending within subtrees. This will help you systematically build the solution.



USER: What would such a DP look like?

BOT: Define a DP state $ f_{u, i} $ which represents the minimum result of the MEX of a path that extends within the subtree rooted at vertex $ u $ and does not include the value $ i $. This will help you calculate the MEX values efficiently as you traverse the tree.



USER: I see the transitions, but they are O(N^2)

BOT: To optimize the transitions, consider that you only need to evaluate MEX values up to $ O\left(\frac{n}{\ln n}\right) $. This reduces the number of states you need to consider, making the solution more efficient.



USER: Why is this true?

BOT: The reason you only need to evaluate MEX values up to $ O\left(\frac{n}{\ln n}\right) $ is based on the distribution of values in the tree. As the tree grows, the number of distinct values that can appear on any path is limited by this bound. This makes it unnecessary to consider higher MEX values, as they will not be optimal. Would you like a more detailed explanation of this concept?
