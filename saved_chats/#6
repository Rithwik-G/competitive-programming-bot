BOT: Would you like hints to help you solve the problem or an interactive explanation of the editorial (hint/editorial)? 



USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: i know the answer is easy when you have a 0, but i can't think of any other cases.

BOT: You're correct that the presence of a zero simplifies the problem significantly. For other cases, consider the following:

- If all digits are 1, the minimum result is straightforward.
- For digits greater than 1, think about how multiplication and addition affect the result.

Would you like a more detailed hint on how to handle cases where all digits are 1 or when there are no zeros and the digits are greater than 1?



USER: Ah, I see how to solve the problem now.

BOT: Great! If you have any more questions or need further clarification on any part of the problem, feel free to ask. I'm here to help!
