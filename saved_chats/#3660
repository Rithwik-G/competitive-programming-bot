USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: Not sure what to do.

BOT: To start solving the problem, consider using recursion to explore the bits of the numbers in the array. You can define a recursive function that tracks the current bit position and the sum of the bits processed so far. Would you like a more detailed hint on how to structure this recursion?
