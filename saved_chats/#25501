BOT: Would you like hints to help you solve the problem or an interactive explanation of the editorial (hint/editorial)? 



USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: not sure what to do

BOT: It seems you might need to think about how to approach the problem using recursion. Consider how you can represent the state of your solution based on the bits of the numbers and the sum you are trying to achieve. Would you like a more detailed hint on how to structure this recursion?



USER: can you elaborate?

BOT: To structure your recursion, define a function that takes the current bit index and the current sum as parameters. You can then determine how many numbers have a 1 in the current bit position and use that to transition to the next bit position, adjusting the sum accordingly based on whether the current bit matches the target sum's bit. Would you like further elaboration on how to implement this transition?
