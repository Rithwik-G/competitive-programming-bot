USER: dynamic programming 

BOT: You're on the right track with dynamic programming. To guide you further, consider defining a state $ dp[i][j] $ where $ dp[i][j] $ represents the minimum sum of the first $ i $ elements after performing $ j $ operations. This will help you systematically explore the possible operations and their effects on the array sum.

Would you like a more detailed hint on how to transition between states in this dynamic programming approach?
