**Hint 1**
We can solve this with dynamic programming. Let $$$\texttt{dp}[i]$$$ store a list of all $$$\min(k, 2^i)$$$ highest beauties of a painting in  order if you only paint cells $$$1,2,\ldots ,i$$$. 
**Hint 2**
Transitioning boils down to finding the $$$k$$$ largest elements from $$$n$$$  lists. Try to do this in $$$\mathcal{O}((n + k) \log n)$$$ time.
**Solution**
Let $$$\texttt{dp}[i]$$$ store a list of all $$$\min(k, 2^i)$$$ highest beauties of a painting in  order if you only paint cells $$$1,2,\ldots ,i$$$. 
Let's define  two lists as creating a new list that stores the $$$k$$$ highest values from the two lists. 
First, let's look at a slow method of transitioning. We iterate over the left endpoint $$$l$$$ such that $$$l \ldots i$$$ is a maximal painted interval. At each $$$l$$$, we merge $$$\texttt{dp}[l - 2]$$$, with $$$a_{l,i}$$$ added to each value, into $$$\texttt{dp}[i]$$$. We also merge $$$\texttt{dp}[i - 1]$$$ into $$$\texttt{dp}[i]$$$ to handle the case in which we do not paint cell $$$i$$$. If implemented well, transitioning takes $$$\mathcal{O}(nk)$$$ time leading to an $$$\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$$$ solution which is too slow.
We can speed this up. This merging process boils down to finding the $$$k$$$ largest elements from $$$n$$$  lists in $$$\mathcal{O}((n + k) \log n)$$$ time. We can use a priority queue that stores ($$$\texttt{element}, \texttt{index}$$$) for each list. We can do the following $$$k$$$ times: add the top of the priority queue to our answer, advance its index, and update the priority queue accordingly. This allows us to transition in $$$\mathcal{O}((n + k) \log n)$$$ time which leads to an $$$\mathcal{O}((n^2 + nk) \log n)$$$ solution.
Bonus: find an $$$\mathcal{O}(n^2 + k)$$$ solution.

Let me know if you have any questions.



USER: how do you know the priority queue thing is ideal when you also have to add the value from a?

BOT: The priority queue approach is ideal because it efficiently merges the top elements from multiple lists, which is crucial for maintaining the highest beauty values. When transitioning, each list in the priority queue represents potential beauty values up to a certain cell. By storing elements as pairs (value, index), we can easily track and update the beauty values. For each cell $i$, we consider all possible left endpoints $l$ and add $a_{l,i}$ to the current beauty values from $\texttt{dp}[l-2]$. This ensures that the beauty values are updated correctly while maintaining the order of the highest values.

The priority queue allows us to efficiently extract the top $k$ elements by always keeping the largest elements at the top. By repeatedly adding the top element to our result, advancing its index, and updating the priority queue, we ensure that the $k$ largest beauty values are always considered. This approach reduces the complexity of merging lists from $\mathcal{O}(nk)$ to $\mathcal{O}((n + k) \log n)$, making it much more efficient for large inputs. This efficiency is crucial for solving the problem within the given constraints.
