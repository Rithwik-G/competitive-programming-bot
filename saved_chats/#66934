USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: I know the subarray length has to be even. I also think that I can iterate over the MSB of the bitwise AND, but i don't know how to check if the XOR has a larger bit set

BOT: You're on the right track by focusing on the MSB (Most Significant Bit) of the bitwise AND. To check if the XOR has a larger bit set, you can use a prefix array to keep track of the XOR values up to each index, considering only the important bits (those greater than the current bit you're examining).

Here's a small hint to guide you further: For each bit $ k $, create a prefix array where each element is the XOR of all previous elements considering only the bits greater than $ k $. Then, for each possible end index $ r $, find the minimum start index $ l $ such that the subarray length is even, the bit $ k $ is set in all elements of the subarray, and the XOR of the subarray (using the prefix array) is zero.

Would you like a more detailed hint on how to construct and use this prefix array?
