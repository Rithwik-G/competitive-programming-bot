BOT: Would you like hints to help you solve the problem or an interactive explanation of the editorial (hint/editorial)? 



USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: C(i, j) = (i choose j)/j!. I swapped the double sum and am thinking about using Lucas' theorem.

BOT: Your approach of using Lucas' theorem is not mentioned in the editorial. Let's focus on the approach discussed in the editorial.

You're on the right track with swapping the double sum. Here's a small hint to guide you further: 

Consider how $C(i, j) \mod j$ behaves for different values of $j$. Specifically, think about the properties of $C(i, j)$ when $j$ is a prime number and when $j$ is composite.

Would you like a more detailed hint on how to handle the contributions for prime $j$ values?



USER: is it true that C(i,j) = (i choose j)/j ?

BOT: Yes, it is true that $ C(i, j) = \frac{{i(i-1)\cdots(i-j+1)}}{j} $. This represents the number of distinct ways to select $ j $ distinct numbers from the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, i\}$ and arrange them in a circle, accounting for rotational symmetry.

Would you like a more detailed hint on how to handle the contributions for prime $ j $ values?



USER: i think its 0 unless j is prime
