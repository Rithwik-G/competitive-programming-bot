BOT: Would you like hints to help you solve the problem or an interactive explanation of the editorial (hint/editorial)? 



USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: I figured out that using the first and last element, we can determine the sequence, so I can solve the problem by iterating over all pairs of first and last elements. But I donâ€™t know how to optimize that further.

BOT: You are on the right track by considering the first and last elements to determine the sequence. Here's a small hint to continue guiding you:

Focus on the fact that the smallest element, 1, will never be removed and must be the last element written down. This means $ h_{N-1} $ must be 1. Use this observation to simplify your problem and discard the last element of $ h $.

Would you like a more detailed hint on how to proceed from here?



USER: But this still doesn't help me get the first and last element...

BOT: To determine the first and last elements, observe that the numbers at the ends of $ p $ are precisely those two missing from $ h $. This means you can identify the first and last elements by finding the two numbers from $ 1 $ to $ N $ that are not present in $ h $.

Would you like more detailed guidance on how to use this observation to reconstruct the permutation?
