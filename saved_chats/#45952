USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: Not really sure what to do

BOT: To start, think about how you can approach the problem recursively by examining the bits of the numbers in the array. Consider how you can represent the state of your recursion based on the bits you're currently analyzing and the sum you want to achieve. Would you like a more detailed hint on how to structure this recursion?
