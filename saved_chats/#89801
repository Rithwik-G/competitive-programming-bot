BOT: Whenever there exists a cow horizontally or vertically adjacent to three other
cows,  Farmer Nhoj is forced to place a cow at the fourth spot.

So this is essentially a flood fill problem; while there exists a location that
should contain a cow but does not, add a cow at that location.
My solution maintains a 2D boolean array of which locations currently contain
cows, as well as a queue of locations in the pasture where a cow needs to be
added. While the queue is nonempty, pop the top element $(x,y)$ of the queue and
check whether a cow has already been added at $(x,y)$. If not, add the cow at
$(x,y)$, and check whether any of the locations
$(x,y),(x,y-1),(x,y+1),(x-1,y),(x+1,y)$ contain cows and are adjacent to exactly
three cows. If so, add all such locations to the queue and repeat.
Additional notes:
The cows that will eventually be present on the pasture after the first $i$
cows are added is a superset of the cows that will eventually be present on the
pasture after the first $i-1$ cows are added. 
This means that we don't need to reset the array between the addition of
each cow.If all cells in $[0,1000]\times [0,1000]$ are initially occupied, Farmer
Nhoj will need to add cows at all locations $(x,y)$ satisfying 
$x+y\ge 0,x+y\le 2000,x-y\le 1000,x-y\ge -1000$ (in other words, a diamond with
vertices at $(-500,500), (500,-500), (1500,500),$ and $(500,1500)$). So if we
increase the $x$ and $y$ cow locations by $500$, then all of these locations
will lie in the range $[0,2000]\times [0,2000]$. 
In my solution, I use $1000$ instead of
$500$.
Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(N+(\text{grid size})^2)$.

Here is an alternative solution by Danny Mittal that does not use a queue:


Let me know if you have any questions.
