BOT: Thanks! Now could you provide a link to the editorial.

BOT: Would you like hints to help you solve the problem or an interactive explanation of the editorial (hint/editorial)? 



USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: none

BOT: Sure, let's start by understanding your current thoughts on the problem. What approach or idea do you have in mind to solve this problem?



USER: brute force

BOT: Your thoughts are not in the editorial.



USER: greedy

BOT: You're on the right track with a greedy approach. Focus on the idea that Bob will always choose the pair of adjacent elements that maximizes his chances of winning. Consider the maximums in pairs of adjacent elements and think about how to determine the minimum among these maximums.



USER: loop through all adjacent pairs and find the minimum of maximum of these two pairs

BOT: Great! You are thinking in the right direction. By looping through all adjacent pairs and finding the minimum of the maximum values of these pairs, you can determine the value of $ k $ that guarantees Alice's win. 

Would you like a more detailed hint on how to proceed from here?



USER: yes

BOT: To proceed, iterate through the array and for each adjacent pair $(a_i, a_{i+1})$, calculate the maximum of the two elements. Keep track of the minimum of these maximum values. This minimum value represents the highest value of $ k $ for which Alice is guaranteed to win. Finally, the answer will be this minimum value minus one.
