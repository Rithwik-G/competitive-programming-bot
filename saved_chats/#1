BOT: **Solution**
Let's consider the block of characters at the end. Notice that their quantity cannot decrease. Let $$$x$$$ be the number of identical characters at the end; there are three possible cases:
$$$x = k$$$ — it is enough to find any block of length greater than $$$k$$$ and separate a block of length $$$k$$$ from it;
$$$x > k$$$ — obviously, there is no solution;
$$$x < k$$$ — find a block of length $$$k - x$$$ or $$$2k - x$$$ and separate a block of length $$$k - x$$$ from it.
This solution works in $$$O(n)$$$, but it is not the only correct one. Your solution may differ significantly from the one proposed.

Let me know if you have any questions.



USER: What other solutions are possible?

BOT: Other solutions to this problem can involve different strategies to achieve a $ k $-proper string after performing the specified operations. One possible approach is to focus on identifying a segment within the string that can be reversed and cyclically shifted to create the desired $ k $-proper structure. For instance, you could look for a segment of length $ k $ that already satisfies the $ k $-proper conditions and then determine the optimal position $ p $ to reverse and shift this segment to the beginning of the string. This approach requires careful analysis of the string to find suitable segments and calculate the necessary transformations.

Another approach could involve dynamic programming or greedy algorithms to systematically check possible positions $ p $ and evaluate the resulting string after the operations. By iterating through different values of $ p $ and simulating the operations, you can determine if the resulting string meets the $ k $-proper criteria. This method might involve more computational steps but can provide a thorough exploration of potential solutions. Both approaches aim to leverage the properties of the binary string and the constraints of the problem to find a valid transformation efficiently.
