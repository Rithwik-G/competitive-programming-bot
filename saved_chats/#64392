BOT: Would you like hints to help you solve the problem or an interactive explanation of the editorial (hint/editorial)? 



USER: hint

BOT: What are you current thoughts on the problem? 



USER: not sure what to do

BOT: It sounds like you might need to consider a recursive approach to solve the problem. Think about how you can represent the state of your solution based on the bits of the numbers and the sum you are trying to achieve. Would you like a more detailed hint on how to structure this recursion?



USER: hm im still confused can you explain more

BOT: To structure your recursion, consider defining a function that takes the current bit index and the current sum as parameters. You will need to keep track of how many bits you've processed and how the sum changes based on the bits you select. Would you like more details on how to implement this recursion?
